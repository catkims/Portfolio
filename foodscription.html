                <p>
                    College students often have extremely busy schedules, 
                    disallowing time to cook food or even have enough time to physically order 
                    and wait for the delivery to arrive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main purpose of this product is to create a subscription service of 
                    foods that a user eats regularly. For example, if a user frequently drinks 
                    coffee and eats a bagel in the morning, they can set up a subscription to 
                    get a coffee and bagel delivered every morning. This way, students can eliminate 
                    the time ordering food and be able to customize their meals rather than having to take time to cook
                    food or waste time having to physically order every time they 
                    want to eat.

                                A message is then sent to their method of choice with steps on how to reset their password.</p>

                    Before starting any work on the project, I created a general schedule on Pivotal Tracker 
                    of when certain features should be released. I organized bigger features by epics, and categorized
                    smaller features in stories. Throughout the project, I updated the schedule
                    and through burn-down charts, I was able to see if my project was on schedule or not.

                    it being too costly.

                        Many existing food delivery apps, such as DoorDash and Uber Eats, require the user to go to the app and 
                        purchase a food item for delivery every time they want food. However, if the user doesn't have enough
                        time, they can't afford going through the delivery process every time. Therefore, I created a way so that
                        a user can still get food delivered, without having to go through the delivery process every time. If the user
                        has a subscription plan set up, they can automatically have food delivered without having to physically order
                        every time.

                        deliverers, where the app's main focus is increasing the tipping for delivery drivers. Whereas for DoorDash,
                        the app's main focus is to provide a way for users to order food from a wide selection of restaurants and have them
                        be delivered to their door. While these are certainly solutions to real issues, they are not solutions to this specific
                        problem statement.

                    <p class="rationale-text">
                        The following are reasons behind my design choices such as why I used certain visual elements, the overall structure
                        of my prototype, and influences from other existing products.

                        <h4>Reason #1</h4>
                        <h3>Visual - Minimalism</h3>
                        <p> While creating this product, I tried to make the design as minimalistic as possible. When there is too
                            much information on one frame at once, it can be very overwhelming for the user, discouraging the use of the
                            product. Therefore, I kept the frames consistent by having white as the main background color and only using 
                            one accent color.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I used navy blue as the accent color because it signifies professionalism to the user. If I had used a brighter color,
                            it would have conveyed a different meaning, and I wanted my product to display business.
                        </p>

                    <div class = "card">
                        <h4>Reason #2</h4>
                        <h3>Visual - Consistency</h3>
                        <p>Throughout this product, I tried to keep designs and functions as consistent as possible. For example, I made sure to
                            include a "save" button wherever a user could change information, so that the user knows that their changes are being saved.
                            I made sure to include a back arrow for every screen that was not a main screen, so that the user can go back to the previous
                            screen. I made sure that for every main screen, there is a bar at the bottom where the user can switch between different flows.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By keeping the design consistent, the user isn't confused by the functionality of an action. The user isn't forced to memorize
                            different functions because functions are the same for each screen.
                        </p>

                    <div class = "card">
                        <h4>Reason #3</h4>
                        <h3>Visual - Match with the Real World</h3>
                        <p>
                            Whenever I used icons, I made sure that the functionality of the icon matches what it would do in the real world. For example,
                            an icon of a home matches with returning to the home screen. Whenever the function of an icon wasn't clear, such as an icon for 
                            a subscription, I made sure to match the word to the icon.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By doing this, functions of icons are intuitive for the user, and the user does not have to guess what an icon does. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To avoid confusing the user, I made sure that features with the same function or related functions stay within the same 
                            page. An example of this includes using popup or a dropdown menu instead of creating a new screen so that the user knows 
                            that they are within the same flow.

                            it poses another problem that it creates a consistent source of economical deficit for students. Like all subscriptions,
                            it takes a portion of the student's money every month, week, or even day, and for some, this is not feasible.

                    While working on this project, I underestimated how much time each frame would take. Additionally, I underestimated the scope of this project.
                    There were many intermediate frames/steps that I did not anticipate. Due to this, I spent a lot of time before the project was due, filling in gaps
                    between flows. While I started this project relatively early, I still spent a lot of crunch time right before the project was due.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I could do this project differently, I would have narrowed down the aspects of this project. While the problem statement and project scope are 
                    relatively narrow, I added too many features such as many things to change in the settings, different aspects of the subscription, etc. However, it
                    difficult to say what to narrow down, as I think many of the features I added are essential. Therefore, if I could do this project differently,
                    I would have spent more time creating a flow chart and low-fidelity prototypes.

                        <p>While creating graphics for this website, I noticed that many of my frames have white as their main color. While this is not bad because it makes
                            the design minimalistic, I thought they were a little bland. Therefore, I will redesign some of the frames so that they are less bland and use a
                            different background color other than white.
